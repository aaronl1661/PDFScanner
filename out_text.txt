Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493

Tee original discovery, exploration, and settlement of North and South America occurred at least 10,000 years before Christopher Columbus was born. Some
archeologists estimate that the first people settled in North America 40,000 years
ago. Migrants from Asia may have crossed a land bridge that once connected
Siberia and Alaska (land now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over time,
people migrated southward from near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of
South America. The first Americans adapted to the varied environments of the
regions that they found. They evolved into hundreds of tribes, spoke different
languages, and practiced different cultures. Estimates of the native population
in the Americas in the 1490s vary from 50 million to 100 million people.

Cultures of Central and South America

The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations.
Between A.D. 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the rain forests
of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico). Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central
Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, had a
population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the largest cities of
Europe. While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the
Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in South America. All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an extensive trade, and
created calendars that were based on accurate scientific observations. All three
cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply, particularly corn (maize) for
the Mayas and Aztecs and potatoes for the Incas.

Cultures of North America

The population in the region north of Mexico (present-day United States and
Canada) in the 1490s may have been anywhere from under | million to more
than 10 million. In general, the native societies in this region were smaller and
Jess sophisticated than those in Mexico and South America. One reason for
this was how slowly the cultivation of corn (maize) spread northward from
Mexico.

Some of the most populous and complex societies in North America had
disappeared by the 15th century, for reasons not well understood. By the time
of Columbus, most people in the Americas in what is now the United States
and Canada lived in semipermanent settlements in groups seldom exceeding
300 people. The men made tools and hunted for game, while the women gathered plants and nuts or grew crops such as corn (maize), beans, and tobacco.

Language Beyond these similarities, the cultures of American Indians
were very diverse. For example, while English, Spanish, and almost all other
European languages were part of just one language family (Indo-European),
American Indian languages constituted more than 20 language families.
Among the largest of these were Algonquian in the Northeast, Siouan on the
Great Plains, and Athabaskan in the Southwest. Together, these 20 families
included more than 400 distinct languages.

Southwest Settlements In the dry region that now includes New Mexico and Arizona, groups such as the Hokokam, Anasazi, and Pueblos evolved
multifaceted societies supported by farming with irrigation systems. In large
numbers they lived in caves, under cliffs, and in multistoried buildings. By the
time Europeans arrived, extreme drought and other hostile natives had taken
their toll on these groups. However, much of their way of life was preserved in
the arid land and their stone and masonry dwellings.

Northwest Settlements Along the Pacific coast from what is today Alaska
to northern California, people lived in permanent longhouses or plank houses.
They had a rich diet based on hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts, berries, and
roots. To save stories, legends, and myths, they carved large totem poles. The
high mountain ranges in this region isolated tribes from one another, creating

barriers to development.

Great Plains Most people who liv
nomadic hunters or sedentary people wt
tribes survived on hunting, principally the buffalo, which supplied their food as
well as decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. They lived in tepees,

frames of poles covered in animal skins, which were easily disassembled and
transported. While the farming tribes also hunted buffalo, they lived permanently in earthen lodges often along rivers. They raised corn (maize), beans,
and squash while actively trading with other tribes. Not until the 17th century
did American Indians acquire horses by trading or stealing them from Spanish
settlers. With horses, tribes such as the Lakota Sioux moved away from farming to hunting and easily following the buffalo across the plains. The plains
tribes would at times merge or split apart as conditions changed. Migration
also was common. For example, the Apaches gradually migrated southward

from Canada to Texas.
Midwest Settlements East of the Mississippi River, the Woodland Amered by hunting, fishing,

ican Indians prospered with a rich food supply. Support
and agriculture, many permanent settlements developed in the Mississippi and
Ohio River valleys and elsewhere. The Adena-Hopewell culture, centered in
what is now Ohio, is famous for the large earthen mounds it created, some
as large as 300 feet long. One of the largest settlements in the Midwest was
Cahokia (near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois), with as many as 30,000
inhabitants.

Northeast Settlements Some descendants
spread from the Ohio Valley into New York. T

ed on the Great Plains were either

and farming. However, their farming techniques exhausted the soil quickly, so
people had to move to fresh land frequently. Among the most famous groups
of American Indians in this region was the Iroquois Confederation, a political
union of five independent tribes who lived in the Mohawk Valley of New York.
The five tribes were the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk.
Multiple families related through a mother lived in longhouses, up to 200 feet
long. From the 16th century through the American Revolution, the Iroquois
were a powerful force, battling rival American Indians as well as Europeans.

Atlantic Seaboard Settlements In the area from New Jersey south to
Florida lived the people of the Coastal Plains. Many were descendants of the
Woodland mound builders and built timber and bark lodgings along rivers. The
rivers and the Atlantic Ocean provided a rich source of food.

Europe Moves Toward Exploration

Until the late 1400s, Americans and the people of Europe, Africa, and Asia
had no knowledge of the people on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. While
Vikings from Scandinavia had visited Greenland and North America around
the year 1000, these voyages had no lasting impact. Columbus’s voyages of
exploration finally brought people into contact across the Atlantic. Several factors made an oceanic crossing and exploration possible in the late 15th century.
Improvements in Technology

In Europe, a rebirth of classical learning prompted an outburst of artistic and
scientific activity in the 15th and 16th centuries known as the Renaissance.
Several of the technological advances during the Renaissance resulted from
Europeans making improvements in the inventions of others. For example,
they began to use gunpowder (invented by the Chinese) and the sailing compass (adopted from Arab merchants who learned about it from the Chinese).
Europeans also made major improvements in shipbuilding and mapmaking. In
addition, the invention of the printing press in the 1450s aided the spread of
knowledge across Europe.

Religious Conflict

The later years of the Renaissance were a time of intense religious zeal and
conflict. The Roman Catholic Church that had once dominated Western Europe
was threatened from without by Ottoman Turks who were followers of Islam
and from within by a revolt against the pope’s authority.

Catholic Victory in Spain In the 8th century, Islamic invaders from
North Africa, known as Moors, rapidly conquered most of what is now Spain.
Over the next several centuries, Spanish Christians reconquered much of the
land and set up several independent kingdoms. Two of the largest of these kingdoms united when Isabella, queen of Castile, and Ferdinand, king of Aragon,
married in 1469. In 1492, under the leadership of Isabella and Ferdinand, the
Spanish conquered the last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the city of Granada.
In that year, the monarchs also funded Christopher Columbus on his historic
first voyage. The uniting of Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand, the conquest

of Granada, and the launching of Columbus signaled new leadership, hope, and
power for Europeans who followed the Roman Catholic faith.

Protestant Revolt in Northern Europe In the early 1500s, certain Christians in Germany, England, France, Holland, and other northern European
countries revolted against the authority of the pope in Rome. Their revolt was
known as the Protestant Reformation. Conflict between Catholics and Protestants led to a series of religious wars. The conflict also caused the Catholics of
Spain and Portugal and the Protestants of England and Holland to want to spread
their own versions of Christianity to people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas,
Thus, a religious motive for exploration and colonization was added to political
and economic motives.

Expanding Trade

Economic motives for exploration grew out of a fierce competition among European kingdoms for increased trade with Africa, India, and China. In the past,
merchants had traveled from the Italian city-state of Venice and the Byzantine
city of Constantinople on a long, slow, expensive overland route that reached all
the way to the capital of the Chinese empire. This land route to Asia had become
blocked in 1453 when the Ottoman Turks seized control of Constantinople.

New Routes So the challenge to finding a new way to the rich Asian trade
appeared to be by sailing either south along the West African coast east to
China, or sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese, who realized
the route south and east was the shortest path, thought this option seemed more
promising. Voyages of exploration sponsored by Portugal’s Prince Henry the
Navigator eventually succeeded in opening up a long sea route around South
Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. In 1498, the Portuguese sea captain Vasco da
Gama was the first European to reach India via this route. By this time, Columbus had attempted what he mistakenly believed would be a shorter route to Asia.

Slave Trading Since ancient times people in Europe, Africa, and Asia had
enslaved people captured in wars. In the 15th century, the Portuguese began
trading for slaves from West Africa. They used the slaves to work newly established sugar plantations on the Madeira and Azores islands off the African coast.
Producing sugar with slave labor was so profitable that when Europeans later
established colonies in the Americas, they used the slave system there.

African Resistance Enslaved Africans resisted slavery in whatever ways
they could. Though transported thousands of miles from their homelands and
brutally repressed, they often ran away, sabotaged work, or revolted. And for
generations they maintained aspects of their African culture, particularly in
music, religion, and folkways.

Developing Nation-States

Europe was also changing politically in the 15th century. Small kingdoms, such
as Castile and Aragon, were uniting into larger ones. Enormous multiethnic
empires, such as the sprawling Holy Roman Empire in central Europe, were
breaking up. Replacing the small kingdoms and the multiethnic empires were

nation-states, countries in which the majority of people shared both a common
culture and common loyalty toward a central government. The monarchs of the
emerging nation-states, such as Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain; Prince Henry
the Navigator of Portugal; and similar monarchs of France, England, and the
Netherlands; depended on trade to bring in needed revenues and on the church
to justify their right to rule. They used their power to search for riches abroad
and to spread the influence of their version of Christianity to new overseas
dominions.

Early Explorations

Changing economic, political, and social conditions in Europe shaped the ambitions of the Italian-born Christopher Columbus.

Christopher Columbus

Columbus spent eight years seeking financial support for his plan to sail west
from Europe to the “Indies.” Finally, in 1492, he succeeded in winning the
backing of Isabella and Ferdinand. The two Spanish monarchs were then at the
height of their power, having just defeated the Moors in Granada. They agreed
to outfit three ships and to make Columbus governor, admiral, and viceroy of all
the lands that he would claim for Spain.

After sailing from the Canary Islands on September 6, Columbus landed on
an island in the Bahamas on October 12. His success in reaching lands on the
other side of the ocean brought him a burst of glory in Spain. But three subsequent voyages across the Atlantic were disappointing—he found little gold, few
spices, and no simple path to China and India.

Columbus’s Legacy Columbus died in 1506, still believing that he had
found a western route to Asia. However, many Spaniards viewed Columbus as
a failure because they suspected that he had found not a valuable trade route,
but a “New World.” Today, some people scoff at Columbus for having erroneously giving the people he encountered the name “Indians.” Even the land that
he had explored was named for someone else, Amerigo Vespucci, another Italian sailor. Columbus’s critics also point out the many problems and injustices
suffered by the natives of the Americas after Europeans arrived and took over
their land.

Nevertheless, most historians agree on Columbus’s importance. Modern
scholars have recognized his great skills as a navigator and his daring commitment in going forth where nobody else had ever dared to venture. Furthermore,
Columbus’s voyages brought about, for the first time in history, permanent interaction between people from all over the globe. He changed the world forever.

Exchanges Europeans and the original inhabitants of the Americas had
developed vastly different cultures over the millennia. The contact between
them resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and
germs from one side of the Atlantic to the other for the first time. Europeans
learned about many new plants and foods, including beans, corn, sweet and

white potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. They also contracted a new disease,
syphilis. Europeans introduced to the Americas sugar cane, bluegrasses, pigs,
and horses, as well as the wheel, iron implements, and guns. Deadlier than al]
the guns was the European importation of germs and diseases, such as smallpox
and measles, to which the natives had no immunity. Millions died (there was
a mortality rate of more than 90 percent), including entire tribal communities,
These exchanges, biological and cultural, would permanently change the entire
world.

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  

Dividing the Americas

Spain and Portugal were the first European kingdoms to claim territories in the
Americas. Their claims overlapped, leading to disputes. The Catholic monarchs
of the two countries turned to the pope in Rome to resolve their differences. In
1493, the pope drew a vertical, north-south line on a world map, called the /ine
of demarcation. The pope granted Spain all lands to the west of the line and
Portugal all lands to the east.

In 1494, Spain and Portugal moved the pope’s line a few degrees to the
west and signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas. The line passed
through what is now the country of Brazil. This treaty, together with Portuguese
explorations, established Portugal’s claim to Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of
the Americas. However, other European countries soon challenged these claims.

  

Spanish Exploration and Conquest

Spanish dominance in the Americas was based on more than a papal ruling and
a treaty. Spain owed its expanding power to its explorers and conquerors (called
conquistadores). Feats such as the journey across the Isthmus of Panama to the
Pacific Ocean by Vasco Niifiez de Balboa, the circumnavigation of the world by
one of Ferdinand Magellan’s ships (Magellan died before completing the trip),
the conquests of the Aztecs in Mexico by Hernan Cortés, and the conquest of
the Incas in Peru by Francisco Pizzaro secured Spain’s initial supremacy in the
Americas.

The conquistadores sent ships loaded with gold and silver back to Spain
from Mexico and Peru. They increased the gold supply by more than 500 percent, making Spain the richest and most powerful nation in Europe. Spain’s
success encouraged other nations to turn to the Americas in search of gold and
power. After seizing the wealth of the Indian empires, the Spanish instituted an
encomienda system, with the king of Spain giving grants of land and natives
to individual Spaniards. These Indians had to farm or work in the mines. The
fruits of their labors went to their Spanish masters, who in turn had to “care” for
them. As Europeans’ diseases and brutality reduced the native population, the
Spanish brought enslaved people from West Africa under the asiento system.
This required the Spanish to pay a tax to their king on each slave they imported
to the Americas.

English Claims
England’s earliest claims to territory in the Americas rested on the voyages of
John Cabot, an Italian sea captain who sailed under contract to England’s King
Henry VII. Cabot explored the coast of Newfoundland in 1497.

England, however, did not follow up Cabot’s discoveries with other expeditions of exploration and settlement. Other issues preoccupied England’s
monarchy in the 1500s, including Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic
Church. In the 1570s and 1580s, under Queen Elizabeth I, England challenged
Spanish shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sir Francis Drake, for
example, attacked Spanish ships, seized the gold and silver that they carried,
and even attacked Spanish settlements on the coast of Peru. Another English
adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, attempted to establish a settlement at Roanoke
Island off the North Carolina coast in 1587, but the venture failed.

French Claims
The French monarchy first showed interest in exploration in 1524 when it spon.
sored a voyage by an Italian navigator, Giovanni da Verrazano. Hoping to fing
a northwest passage leading through the Americas to Asia, Verrazano explored
part of North America’s eastern coast, including the New York harbor. French
claims to American territory were also based on the voyages of Jacques Cartier
(1534-1542), who explored the St. Lawrence River extensively.

Like the English, the French were slow to develop colonies across the Atlantic. During the 1500s, the French monarchy was preoccupied with European
wars as well as with internal religious conflict between Roman Catholics and
French Protestants known as Huguenots. Only in the next century did France
develop a strong interest in following up its claims to North American land.

The first permanent French settlement in America was established by Samuel de Champlain in 1608 at Quebec, a fortified village on the St. Lawrence
River, Champlain’s strong leadership won him the nickname “Father of New
France.” Other explorers extended French claims across a vast territory. In
1673, Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper Mississippi River, and in 1682, Robert de La Salle explored the Mississippi basin,
which he named Louisiana (after the French king, Louis XIV).

Dutch Claims

During the 1600s, the Netherlands also began to sponsor voyages of exploration. The Dutch government hired Henry Hudson, an experienced English
sailor, to seek westward passage to Asia through northern America. In 1609,
while searching for a northwest passage, Hudson sailed up a broad river that
was later named for him, the Hudson River. This expedition established Dutch
claims to the surrounding area that would become New Amsterdam (and later
New York). The Dutch government granted a private company, the Dutch West
India Company, the right to control the region for economic gain.

Spanish Settlements in North America
Spanish settlements developed slowly in North America, as a result of limited
mineral resources and strong opposition from American Indians.

Florida After a number of failed attempts and against the strong resistance
of American Indians in the region, the Spanish established a permanent settlement at St. Augustine in 1565. Today, St. Augustine is the oldest city in North
America founded by Europeans.

New Mexico Santa Fe was established as the capital of New Mexico in
1610. Harsh efforts to Christianize the American Indians caused the Pueblo
people to revolt in 1680. The Spanish were driven from the area until 1692.

Texas In between Florida and New Mexico, the Spanish established settlements in Texas. These communities grew in the early 1700s as Spain attempted
to resist French efforts to explore the lower Mississippi River.

California In response to Russian exploration from Alaska, the Spanish
established permanent settlements at San Diego in 1769 and San Francisco in
1776. By 1784, a series of missions or settlements had been established along
the California coast by members of the Franciscan order. Father Junipero Serra
founded nine of these missions.

European Treatment of Native Americans

Most Europeans looked down upon Native Americans. The Europeans who colonized North and South America generally viewed Native Americans as inferior
people who could be exploited for economic gain, converted to Christianity,
and used as military allies. However, Europeans used various approaches for
controlling Native Americans and operating their colonies.

Spanish Policy

The Spanish who settled in Mexico and Peru encountered the highly organized Aztec and Inca empires. Even after diseases killed most natives, millions
remained in these empires that the Spanish could incorporate as laborers in their
own empire. Many natives who did not die from disease died from forced labor.
Because few families came from Spain to settle the empire, the explorers and
soldiers intermarried with natives as well as with Africans. The latter were captured in Africa and forced to travel across the ocean to provide slave labor for
the Spanish colonists. A rigid class system developed in the Spanish colonies,
one dominated by pure-blooded Spaniards.

Bartolomé de Las Casas One European who dissented from the views
of most Europeans toward Native Americans was a Spanish priest named Bartolomé de Las Casas. Though he had owned land and slaves in the West Indies
and had fought in wars against the Indians, he eventually became an advocate
for better treatment for Indians. He persuaded the king to institute the New
Laws of 1542. These laws ended Indian slavery, halted forced Indian labor,
and began to end the encomienda system which kept the Indians in serfdom.
Conservative Spaniards, eager to keep the encomienda system, responded and
successfully pushed the king to repeal parts of the New Laws.

Valladolid Debate The debate over the role for Indians in the Spanish
colonies came to a head in a formal debate in 1550-1551 in Valladolid, Spain.
On one side, Las Casas argued that the Indians were completely human and
morally equal to Europeans. so enslaving them was not justified. On the other
side, another priest, Juan Ginés de Sepulveda, argued that Indians were less than
human. Hence, they benefited from serving the Spaniards in the econmienda
system. Neither side clearly won the debate. Though Las Casas was unable to
gain equal treatment for Native Americans, he established the basic arguments
on behalf of justice for Indians.

English Policy

Unlike the Spanish, the English settled in areas without large native empires
that could be controlled as a workforce. In addition, many English colonists
came in families rather than as single young men, so marriage with natives was
less common. Initially, at least in Massachusetts, the English and the American
Indians coexisted, traded, and shared ideas. American Indians taught the settlers
how to grow new crops such as corn (maize) and showed them how to hunt
in the forests. They traded various furs for an array of English manufactureq
goods, including iron tools and weapons. But peaceful relations soon gave way
to conflict and open warfare. The English had no respect for American Indian
cultures, which they viewed as primitive or “savage.” For their part, American
Indians saw their way of life threatened as the English began to take more land
to support their ever-increasing population. The English occupied the land and
forced the small, scattered tribes they encountered to move away from the coast
to inland territories. They expelled the natives rather than subjugating them,

French Policy

The French, looking for furs and converts to Catholicism, viewed American
Indians as potential economic and military allies. Compared to the Spaniards
and the English, the French maintained good relations with the tribes they
encountered. Seeking to control the fur trade, the French built trading posts
throughout the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, and along the Mississippi River. At these posts, they exchanged French goods for beaver pelts and
other furs collected by American Indians. Because the French had few colonists, farms, or towns, they posed less threat to the native population than did
other Europeans. In addition, French soldiers assisted the Huron people in fighting their traditional enemy, the Iroquois.

Native American Reaction

North American tribes saw themselves as groups distinct from each other, not
as part of a larger body of Native Americans. As a result, European settlers
rarely had to be concerned with a unified response from the Native Americans.
Initially the European goods such as copper pots and guns had motivated the
natives to interact with the strangers. After the decimation of their peoples from
the violence and disease of the Europeans, the Native Americans had to adopt
new ways to survive. Upon observing the Europeans fighting each other, some
tribes allied themselves with one European power or another in hopes of gaining support in order to survive. A number of tribes simply migrated to new land
to get away from the slowly encroaching settlers. Regardless of how they dealt
with the European invasion, Native Americans would never be able to return to
the life they had known prior to 1492.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES: WAS COLUMBUS A GREAT HERO?

Over the centuries, Columbus has received both praise for his role as a
“discoverer” and blame for his actions as a “conqueror.” In the United
States, he has traditionally been viewed as a hero. As early as 1828,
Washington Irving wrote a popular biography extolling the explorer’s
virtues. The apex of Columbus’s heroic reputation was reached in 1934
when President Franklin Roosevelt declared October 12 a national
holiday.

Since the 1990s, however, revisionist histories and biographies have
been highly critical of Columbus. His detractors argue that Columbus
was simply at the right place at the right time. Europe at the end of the
15th century was ready to expand. If Columbus had not crossed the
Atlantic in 1492, some other explorer—perhaps Vespucci or Cabot—
would have done so a few years later. According to this interpretation,
Columbus was little more than a good navigator and a self-promoter
who exploited an opportunity.

Some revisionists take a harsh view of Columbus and regard him
not as the first discoverer of America but rather as its first conqueror.
They portray him as a religious fanatic in the European Christian tradition who sought to convert the American natives to Christianity and
liquidated those who resisted.

The revisionist argument has not gone unanswered. For example,
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. has argued that the chief motivation
for Columbus’s deeds was neither greed for gold nor ambition for conquest. What drove him, in Schlesinger’s view, was the challenge of the
unknown. Columbus’s apologists admit that millions of Native Americans died as a result of European exploration in the Americas, but they
point out that an unknown number had suffered horrible deaths in Aztec
sacrifices. Moreover, the mistreatment of Native Americans was perhaps partially offset by such positive results as the gradual development
of democratic institutions in the colonies and later the United States.

Historians will continue to debate the nature of Columbus’s achievement. As with other historical questions, distinguishing between fact
and fiction and separating a writer’s personal biases from objective reality is difficult. One conclusion is inescapable: As a result of Columbus’s
voyages, world history took a sharp turn in a new direction. His explorations established a permanent point of contact between Europeans and
the first Americans, and soon between both groups and Africans. People
are still living with the consequences of this interaction.

Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493

Tee original discovery, exploration, and settlement of North and South America occurred at least 10,000 years before Christopher Columbus was born. Some
archeologists estimate that the first people settled in North America 40,000 years
ago. Migrants from Asia may have crossed a land bridge that once connected
Siberia and Alaska (land now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over time,
people migrated southward from near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of
South America. The first Americans adapted to the varied environments of the
regions that they found. They evolved into hundreds of tribes, spoke different
languages, and practiced different cultures. Estimates of the native population
in the Americas in the 1490s vary from 50 million to 100 million people.

Cultures of Central and South America

The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations.
Between A.D. 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the rain forests
of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico). Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central
Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, had a
population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the largest cities of
Europe. While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the
Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in South America. All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an extensive trade, and
created calendars that were based on accurate scientific observations. All three
cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply, particularly corn (maize) for
the Mayas and Aztecs and potatoes for the Incas.

1Cultures of North America

The population in the region north of Mexico (present-day United States and
Canada) in the 1490s may have been anywhere from under | million to more
than 10 million. In general, the native societies in this region were smaller and
Jess sophisticated than those in Mexico and South America. One reason for
this was how slowly the cultivation of corn (maize) spread northward from
Mexico.

Some of the most populous and complex societies in North America had
disappeared by the 15th century, for reasons not well understood. By the time
of Columbus, most people in the Americas in what is now the United States
and Canada lived in semipermanent settlements in groups seldom exceeding
300 people. The men made tools and hunted for game, while the women gathered plants and nuts or grew crops such as corn (maize), beans, and tobacco.

Language Beyond these similarities, the cultures of American Indians
were very diverse. For example, while English, Spanish, and almost all other
European languages were part of just one language family (Indo-European),
American Indian languages constituted more than 20 language families.
Among the largest of these were Algonquian in the Northeast, Siouan on the
Great Plains, and Athabaskan in the Southwest. Together, these 20 families
included more than 400 distinct languages.

Southwest Settlements In the dry region that now includes New Mexico and Arizona, groups such as the Hokokam, Anasazi, and Pueblos evolved
multifaceted societies supported by farming with irrigation systems. In large
numbers they lived in caves, under cliffs, and in multistoried buildings. By the
time Europeans arrived, extreme drought and other hostile natives had taken
their toll on these groups. However, much of their way of life was preserved in
the arid land and their stone and masonry dwellings.

Northwest Settlements Along the Pacific coast from what is today Alaska
to northern California, people lived in permanent longhouses or plank houses.
They had a rich diet based on hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts, berries, and
roots. To save stories, legends, and myths, they carved large totem poles. The
high mountain ranges in this region isolated tribes from one another, creating

barriers to development.

Great Plains Most people who liv
nomadic hunters or sedentary people wt
tribes survived on hunting, principally the buffalo, which supplied their food as
well as decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. They lived in tepees,

frames of poles covered in animal skins, which were easily disassembled and
transported. While the farming tribes also hunted buffalo, they lived permanently in earthen lodges often along rivers. They raised corn (maize), beans,
and squash while actively trading with other tribes. Not until the 17th century
did American Indians acquire horses by trading or stealing them from Spanish
settlers. With horses, tribes such as the Lakota Sioux moved away from farming to hunting and easily following the buffalo across the plains. The plains
tribes would at times merge or split apart as conditions changed. Migration
also was common. For example, the Apaches gradually migrated southward

from Canada to Texas.
Midwest Settlements East of the Mississippi River, the Woodland Amered by hunting, fishing,

ican Indians prospered with a rich food supply. Support
and agriculture, many permanent settlements developed in the Mississippi and
Ohio River valleys and elsewhere. The Adena-Hopewell culture, centered in
what is now Ohio, is famous for the large earthen mounds it created, some
as large as 300 feet long. One of the largest settlements in the Midwest was
Cahokia (near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois), with as many as 30,000
inhabitants.

Northeast Settlements Some descendants
spread from the Ohio Valley into New York. T

ed on the Great Plains were either

and farming. However, their farming techniques exhausted the soil quickly, so
people had to move to fresh land frequently. Among the most famous groups
of American Indians in this region was the Iroquois Confederation, a political
union of five independent tribes who lived in the Mohawk Valley of New York.
The five tribes were the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk.
Multiple families related through a mother lived in longhouses, up to 200 feet
long. From the 16th century through the American Revolution, the Iroquois
were a powerful force, battling rival American Indians as well as Europeans.

Atlantic Seaboard Settlements In the area from New Jersey south to
Florida lived the people of the Coastal Plains. Many were descendants of the
Woodland mound builders and built timber and bark lodgings along rivers. The
rivers and the Atlantic Ocean provided a rich source of food.

Europe Moves Toward Exploration

Until the late 1400s, Americans and the people of Europe, Africa, and Asia
had no knowledge of the people on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. While
Vikings from Scandinavia had visited Greenland and North America around
the year 1000, these voyages had no lasting impact. Columbus’s voyages of
exploration finally brought people into contact across the Atlantic. Several factors made an oceanic crossing and exploration possible in the late 15th century.
Improvements in Technology

In Europe, a rebirth of classical learning prompted an outburst of artistic and
scientific activity in the 15th and 16th centuries known as the Renaissance.
Several of the technological advances during the Renaissance resulted from
Europeans making improvements in the inventions of others. For example,
they began to use gunpowder (invented by the Chinese) and the sailing compass (adopted from Arab merchants who learned about it from the Chinese).
Europeans also made major improvements in shipbuilding and mapmaking. In
addition, the invention of the printing press in the 1450s aided the spread of
knowledge across Europe.

Religious Conflict

The later years of the Renaissance were a time of intense religious zeal and
conflict. The Roman Catholic Church that had once dominated Western Europe
was threatened from without by Ottoman Turks who were followers of Islam
and from within by a revolt against the pope’s authority.

Catholic Victory in Spain In the 8th century, Islamic invaders from
North Africa, known as Moors, rapidly conquered most of what is now Spain.
Over the next several centuries, Spanish Christians reconquered much of the
land and set up several independent kingdoms. Two of the largest of these kingdoms united when Isabella, queen of Castile, and Ferdinand, king of Aragon,
married in 1469. In 1492, under the leadership of Isabella and Ferdinand, the
Spanish conquered the last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the city of Granada.
In that year, the monarchs also funded Christopher Columbus on his historic
first voyage. The uniting of Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand, the conquest

of Granada, and the launching of Columbus signaled new leadership, hope, and
power for Europeans who followed the Roman Catholic faith.

Protestant Revolt in Northern Europe In the early 1500s, certain Christians in Germany, England, France, Holland, and other northern European
countries revolted against the authority of the pope in Rome. Their revolt was
known as the Protestant Reformation. Conflict between Catholics and Protestants led to a series of religious wars. The conflict also caused the Catholics of
Spain and Portugal and the Protestants of England and Holland to want to spread
their own versions of Christianity to people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas,
Thus, a religious motive for exploration and colonization was added to political
and economic motives.

Expanding Trade

Economic motives for exploration grew out of a fierce competition among European kingdoms for increased trade with Africa, India, and China. In the past,
merchants had traveled from the Italian city-state of Venice and the Byzantine
city of Constantinople on a long, slow, expensive overland route that reached all
the way to the capital of the Chinese empire. This land route to Asia had become
blocked in 1453 when the Ottoman Turks seized control of Constantinople.

New Routes So the challenge to finding a new way to the rich Asian trade
appeared to be by sailing either south along the West African coast east to
China, or sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese, who realized
the route south and east was the shortest path, thought this option seemed more
promising. Voyages of exploration sponsored by Portugal’s Prince Henry the
Navigator eventually succeeded in opening up a long sea route around South
Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. In 1498, the Portuguese sea captain Vasco da
Gama was the first European to reach India via this route. By this time, Columbus had attempted what he mistakenly believed would be a shorter route to Asia.

Slave Trading Since ancient times people in Europe, Africa, and Asia had
enslaved people captured in wars. In the 15th century, the Portuguese began
trading for slaves from West Africa. They used the slaves to work newly established sugar plantations on the Madeira and Azores islands off the African coast.
Producing sugar with slave labor was so profitable that when Europeans later
established colonies in the Americas, they used the slave system there.

African Resistance Enslaved Africans resisted slavery in whatever ways
they could. Though transported thousands of miles from their homelands and
brutally repressed, they often ran away, sabotaged work, or revolted. And for
generations they maintained aspects of their African culture, particularly in
music, religion, and folkways.

Developing Nation-States

Europe was also changing politically in the 15th century. Small kingdoms, such
as Castile and Aragon, were uniting into larger ones. Enormous multiethnic
empires, such as the sprawling Holy Roman Empire in central Europe, were
breaking up. Replacing the small kingdoms and the multiethnic empires were

nation-states, countries in which the majority of people shared both a common
culture and common loyalty toward a central government. The monarchs of the
emerging nation-states, such as Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain; Prince Henry
the Navigator of Portugal; and similar monarchs of France, England, and the
Netherlands; depended on trade to bring in needed revenues and on the church
to justify their right to rule. They used their power to search for riches abroad
and to spread the influence of their version of Christianity to new overseas
dominions.

Early Explorations

Changing economic, political, and social conditions in Europe shaped the ambitions of the Italian-born Christopher Columbus.

Christopher Columbus

Columbus spent eight years seeking financial support for his plan to sail west
from Europe to the “Indies.” Finally, in 1492, he succeeded in winning the
backing of Isabella and Ferdinand. The two Spanish monarchs were then at the
height of their power, having just defeated the Moors in Granada. They agreed
to outfit three ships and to make Columbus governor, admiral, and viceroy of all
the lands that he would claim for Spain.

After sailing from the Canary Islands on September 6, Columbus landed on
an island in the Bahamas on October 12. His success in reaching lands on the
other side of the ocean brought him a burst of glory in Spain. But three subsequent voyages across the Atlantic were disappointing—he found little gold, few
spices, and no simple path to China and India.

Columbus’s Legacy Columbus died in 1506, still believing that he had
found a western route to Asia. However, many Spaniards viewed Columbus as
a failure because they suspected that he had found not a valuable trade route,
but a “New World.” Today, some people scoff at Columbus for having erroneously giving the people he encountered the name “Indians.” Even the land that
he had explored was named for someone else, Amerigo Vespucci, another Italian sailor. Columbus’s critics also point out the many problems and injustices
suffered by the natives of the Americas after Europeans arrived and took over
their land.

Nevertheless, most historians agree on Columbus’s importance. Modern
scholars have recognized his great skills as a navigator and his daring commitment in going forth where nobody else had ever dared to venture. Furthermore,
Columbus’s voyages brought about, for the first time in history, permanent interaction between people from all over the globe. He changed the world forever.

Exchanges Europeans and the original inhabitants of the Americas had
developed vastly different cultures over the millennia. The contact between
them resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and
germs from one side of the Atlantic to the other for the first time. Europeans
learned about many new plants and foods, including beans, corn, sweet and

white potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. They also contracted a new disease,
syphilis. Europeans introduced to the Americas sugar cane, bluegrasses, pigs,
and horses, as well as the wheel, iron implements, and guns. Deadlier than al]
the guns was the European importation of germs and diseases, such as smallpox
and measles, to which the natives had no immunity. Millions died (there was
a mortality rate of more than 90 percent), including entire tribal communities,
These exchanges, biological and cultural, would permanently change the entire
world.

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  

Dividing the Americas

Spain and Portugal were the first European kingdoms to claim territories in the
Americas. Their claims overlapped, leading to disputes. The Catholic monarchs
of the two countries turned to the pope in Rome to resolve their differences. In
1493, the pope drew a vertical, north-south line on a world map, called the /ine
of demarcation. The pope granted Spain all lands to the west of the line and
Portugal all lands to the east.

In 1494, Spain and Portugal moved the pope’s line a few degrees to the
west and signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas. The line passed
through what is now the country of Brazil. This treaty, together with Portuguese
explorations, established Portugal’s claim to Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of
the Americas. However, other European countries soon challenged these claims.

  

Spanish Exploration and Conquest

Spanish dominance in the Americas was based on more than a papal ruling and
a treaty. Spain owed its expanding power to its explorers and conquerors (called
conquistadores). Feats such as the journey across the Isthmus of Panama to the
Pacific Ocean by Vasco Niifiez de Balboa, the circumnavigation of the world by
one of Ferdinand Magellan’s ships (Magellan died before completing the trip),
the conquests of the Aztecs in Mexico by Hernan Cortés, and the conquest of
the Incas in Peru by Francisco Pizzaro secured Spain’s initial supremacy in the
Americas.

The conquistadores sent ships loaded with gold and silver back to Spain
from Mexico and Peru. They increased the gold supply by more than 500 percent, making Spain the richest and most powerful nation in Europe. Spain’s
success encouraged other nations to turn to the Americas in search of gold and
power. After seizing the wealth of the Indian empires, the Spanish instituted an
encomienda system, with the king of Spain giving grants of land and natives
to individual Spaniards. These Indians had to farm or work in the mines. The
fruits of their labors went to their Spanish masters, who in turn had to “care” for
them. As Europeans’ diseases and brutality reduced the native population, the
Spanish brought enslaved people from West Africa under the asiento system.
This required the Spanish to pay a tax to their king on each slave they imported
to the Americas.

English Claims
England’s earliest claims to territory in the Americas rested on the voyages of
John Cabot, an Italian sea captain who sailed under contract to England’s King
Henry VII. Cabot explored the coast of Newfoundland in 1497.

England, however, did not follow up Cabot’s discoveries with other expeditions of exploration and settlement. Other issues preoccupied England’s
monarchy in the 1500s, including Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic
Church. In the 1570s and 1580s, under Queen Elizabeth I, England challenged
Spanish shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sir Francis Drake, for
example, attacked Spanish ships, seized the gold and silver that they carried,
and even attacked Spanish settlements on the coast of Peru. Another English
adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, attempted to establish a settlement at Roanoke
Island off the North Carolina coast in 1587, but the venture failed.

French Claims
The French monarchy first showed interest in exploration in 1524 when it spon.
sored a voyage by an Italian navigator, Giovanni da Verrazano. Hoping to fing
a northwest passage leading through the Americas to Asia, Verrazano explored
part of North America’s eastern coast, including the New York harbor. French
claims to American territory were also based on the voyages of Jacques Cartier
(1534-1542), who explored the St. Lawrence River extensively.

Like the English, the French were slow to develop colonies across the Atlantic. During the 1500s, the French monarchy was preoccupied with European
wars as well as with internal religious conflict between Roman Catholics and
French Protestants known as Huguenots. Only in the next century did France
develop a strong interest in following up its claims to North American land.

The first permanent French settlement in America was established by Samuel de Champlain in 1608 at Quebec, a fortified village on the St. Lawrence
River, Champlain’s strong leadership won him the nickname “Father of New
France.” Other explorers extended French claims across a vast territory. In
1673, Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper Mississippi River, and in 1682, Robert de La Salle explored the Mississippi basin,
which he named Louisiana (after the French king, Louis XIV).

Dutch Claims

During the 1600s, the Netherlands also began to sponsor voyages of exploration. The Dutch government hired Henry Hudson, an experienced English
sailor, to seek westward passage to Asia through northern America. In 1609,
while searching for a northwest passage, Hudson sailed up a broad river that
was later named for him, the Hudson River. This expedition established Dutch
claims to the surrounding area that would become New Amsterdam (and later
New York). The Dutch government granted a private company, the Dutch West
India Company, the right to control the region for economic gain.

Spanish Settlements in North America
Spanish settlements developed slowly in North America, as a result of limited
mineral resources and strong opposition from American Indians.

Florida After a number of failed attempts and against the strong resistance
of American Indians in the region, the Spanish established a permanent settlement at St. Augustine in 1565. Today, St. Augustine is the oldest city in North
America founded by Europeans.

New Mexico Santa Fe was established as the capital of New Mexico in
1610. Harsh efforts to Christianize the American Indians caused the Pueblo
people to revolt in 1680. The Spanish were driven from the area until 1692.

Texas In between Florida and New Mexico, the Spanish established settlements in Texas. These communities grew in the early 1700s as Spain attempted
to resist French efforts to explore the lower Mississippi River.

California In response to Russian exploration from Alaska, the Spanish
established permanent settlements at San Diego in 1769 and San Francisco in
1776. By 1784, a series of missions or settlements had been established along
the California coast by members of the Franciscan order. Father Junipero Serra
founded nine of these missions.

European Treatment of Native Americans

Most Europeans looked down upon Native Americans. The Europeans who colonized North and South America generally viewed Native Americans as inferior
people who could be exploited for economic gain, converted to Christianity,
and used as military allies. However, Europeans used various approaches for
controlling Native Americans and operating their colonies.

Spanish Policy

The Spanish who settled in Mexico and Peru encountered the highly organized Aztec and Inca empires. Even after diseases killed most natives, millions
remained in these empires that the Spanish could incorporate as laborers in their
own empire. Many natives who did not die from disease died from forced labor.
Because few families came from Spain to settle the empire, the explorers and
soldiers intermarried with natives as well as with Africans. The latter were captured in Africa and forced to travel across the ocean to provide slave labor for
the Spanish colonists. A rigid class system developed in the Spanish colonies,
one dominated by pure-blooded Spaniards.

Bartolomé de Las Casas One European who dissented from the views
of most Europeans toward Native Americans was a Spanish priest named Bartolomé de Las Casas. Though he had owned land and slaves in the West Indies
and had fought in wars against the Indians, he eventually became an advocate
for better treatment for Indians. He persuaded the king to institute the New
Laws of 1542. These laws ended Indian slavery, halted forced Indian labor,
and began to end the encomienda system which kept the Indians in serfdom.
Conservative Spaniards, eager to keep the encomienda system, responded and
successfully pushed the king to repeal parts of the New Laws.

Valladolid Debate The debate over the role for Indians in the Spanish
colonies came to a head in a formal debate in 1550-1551 in Valladolid, Spain.
On one side, Las Casas argued that the Indians were completely human and
morally equal to Europeans. so enslaving them was not justified. On the other
side, another priest, Juan Ginés de Sepulveda, argued that Indians were less than
human. Hence, they benefited from serving the Spaniards in the econmienda
system. Neither side clearly won the debate. Though Las Casas was unable to
gain equal treatment for Native Americans, he established the basic arguments

English Policy

Unlike the Spanish, the English settled in areas without large native empires
that could be controlled as a workforce. In addition, many English colonists
came in families rather than as single young men, so marriage with natives was
less common. Initially, at least in Massachusetts, the English and the American
Indians coexisted, traded, and shared ideas. American Indians taught the settlers
how to grow new crops such as corn (maize) and showed them how to hunt
in the forests. They traded various furs for an array of English manufactureq
goods, including iron tools and weapons. But peaceful relations soon gave way
to conflict and open warfare. The English had no respect for American Indian
cultures, which they viewed as primitive or “savage.” For their part, American
Indians saw their way of life threatened as the English began to take more land
to support their ever-increasing population. The English occupied the land and
forced the small, scattered tribes they encountered to move away from the coast
to inland territories. They expelled the natives rather than subjugating them,

French Policy

The French, looking for furs and converts to Catholicism, viewed American
Indians as potential economic and military allies. Compared to the Spaniards
and the English, the French maintained good relations with the tribes they
encountered. Seeking to control the fur trade, the French built trading posts
throughout the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, and along the Mississippi River. At these posts, they exchanged French goods for beaver pelts and
other furs collected by American Indians. Because the French had few colonists, farms, or towns, they posed less threat to the native population than did
other Europeans. In addition, French soldiers assisted the Huron people in fighting their traditional enemy, the Iroquois.

Native American Reaction

North American tribes saw themselves as groups distinct from each other, not
as part of a larger body of Native Americans. As a result, European settlers
rarely had to be concerned with a unified response from the Native Americans.
Initially the European goods such as copper pots and guns had motivated the
natives to interact with the strangers. After the decimation of their peoples from
the violence and disease of the Europeans, the Native Americans had to adopt
new ways to survive. Upon observing the Europeans fighting each other, some
tribes allied themselves with one European power or another in hopes of gaining support in order to survive. A number of tribes simply migrated to new land
to get away from the slowly encroaching settlers. Regardless of how they dealt
with the European invasion, Native Americans would never be able to return to
the life they had known prior to 1492.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES: WAS COLUMBUS A GREAT HERO?

Over the centuries, Columbus has received both praise for his role as a
“discoverer” and blame for his actions as a “conqueror.” In the United
States, he has traditionally been viewed as a hero. As early as 1828,
Washington Irving wrote a popular biography extolling the explorer’s
virtues. The apex of Columbus’s heroic reputation was reached in 1934
when President Franklin Roosevelt declared October 12 a national
holiday.

Since the 1990s, however, revisionist histories and biographies have
been highly critical of Columbus. His detractors argue that Columbus
was simply at the right place at the right time. Europe at the end of the
15th century was ready to expand. If Columbus had not crossed the
Atlantic in 1492, some other explorer—perhaps Vespucci or Cabot—
would have done so a few years later. According to this interpretation,
Columbus was little more than a good navigator and a self-promoter
who exploited an opportunity.

Some revisionists take a harsh view of Columbus and regard him
not as the first discoverer of America but rather as its first conqueror.
They portray him as a religious fanatic in the European Christian tradition who sought to convert the American natives to Christianity and
liquidated those who resisted.

The revisionist argument has not gone unanswered. For example,
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. has argued that the chief motivation
for Columbus’s deeds was neither greed for gold nor ambition for conquest. What drove him, in Schlesinger’s view, was the challenge of the
unknown. Columbus’s apologists admit that millions of Native Americans died as a result of European exploration in the Americas, but they
point out that an unknown number had suffered horrible deaths in Aztec
sacrifices. Moreover, the mistreatment of Native Americans was perhaps partially offset by such positive results as the gradual development
of democratic institutions in the colonies and later the United States.

Historians will continue to debate the nature of Columbus’s achievement. As with other historical questions, distinguishing between fact
and fiction and separating a writer’s personal biases from objective reality is difficult. One conclusion is inescapable: As a result of Columbus’s
voyages, world history took a sharp turn in a new direction. His explorations established a permanent point of contact between Europeans and
the first Americans, and soon between both groups and Africans. People
are still living with the consequences of this interaction.

Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493

Tee original discovery, exploration, and settlement of North and South America occurred at least 10,000 years before Christopher Columbus was born. Some
archeologists estimate that the first people settled in North America 40,000 years
ago. Migrants from Asia may have crossed a land bridge that once connected
Siberia and Alaska (land now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over time,
people migrated southward from near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of
South America. The first Americans adapted to the varied environments of the
regions that they found. They evolved into hundreds of tribes, spoke different
languages, and practiced different cultures. Estimates of the native population
in the Americas in the 1490s vary from 50 million to 100 million people.

Cultures of Central and South America

The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations.
Between A.D. 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the rain forests
of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico). Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central
Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, had a
population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the largest cities of
Europe. While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the
Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in South America. All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an extensive trade, and
created calendars that were based on accurate scientific observations. All three
cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply, particularly corn (maize) for
the Mayas and Aztecs and potatoes for the Incas.

1Cultures of North America

The population in the region north of Mexico (present-day United States and
Canada) in the 1490s may have been anywhere from under | million to more
than 10 million. In general, the native societies in this region were smaller and
Jess sophisticated than those in Mexico and South America. One reason for
this was how slowly the cultivation of corn (maize) spread northward from
Mexico.

Some of the most populous and complex societies in North America had
disappeared by the 15th century, for reasons not well understood. By the time
of Columbus, most people in the Americas in what is now the United States
and Canada lived in semipermanent settlements in groups seldom exceeding
300 people. The men made tools and hunted for game, while the women gathered plants and nuts or grew crops such as corn (maize), beans, and tobacco.

Language Beyond these similarities, the cultures of American Indians
were very diverse. For example, while English, Spanish, and almost all other
European languages were part of just one language family (Indo-European),
American Indian languages constituted more than 20 language families.
Among the largest of these were Algonquian in the Northeast, Siouan on the
Great Plains, and Athabaskan in the Southwest. Together, these 20 families
included more than 400 distinct languages.

Southwest Settlements In the dry region that now includes New Mexico and Arizona, groups such as the Hokokam, Anasazi, and Pueblos evolved
multifaceted societies supported by farming with irrigation systems. In large
numbers they lived in caves, under cliffs, and in multistoried buildings. By the
time Europeans arrived, extreme drought and other hostile natives had taken
their toll on these groups. However, much of their way of life was preserved in
the arid land and their stone and masonry dwellings.

Northwest Settlements Along the Pacific coast from what is today Alaska
to northern California, people lived in permanent longhouses or plank houses.
They had a rich diet based on hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts, berries, and
roots. To save stories, legends, and myths, they carved large totem poles. The
high mountain ranges in this region isolated tribes from one another, creating

barriers to development.

Great Plains Most people who liv
nomadic hunters or sedentary people wt
tribes survived on hunting, principally the buffalo, which supplied their food as
well as decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. They lived in tepees,

frames of poles covered in animal skins, which were easily disassembled and
transported. While the farming tribes also hunted buffalo, they lived permanently in earthen lodges often along rivers. They raised corn (maize), beans,
and squash while actively trading with other tribes. Not until the 17th century
did American Indians acquire horses by trading or stealing them from Spanish
settlers. With horses, tribes such as the Lakota Sioux moved away from farming to hunting and easily following the buffalo across the plains. The plains
tribes would at times merge or split apart as conditions changed. Migration
also was common. For example, the Apaches gradually migrated southward

from Canada to Texas.
Midwest Settlements East of the Mississippi River, the Woodland Amered by hunting, fishing,

ican Indians prospered with a rich food supply. Support
and agriculture, many permanent settlements developed in the Mississippi and
Ohio River valleys and elsewhere. The Adena-Hopewell culture, centered in
what is now Ohio, is famous for the large earthen mounds it created, some
as large as 300 feet long. One of the largest settlements in the Midwest was
Cahokia (near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois), with as many as 30,000
inhabitants.

Northeast Settlements Some descendants
spread from the Ohio Valley into New York. T

ed on the Great Plains were either
ho farmed and traded. The nomadic

and farming. However, their farming techniques exhausted the soil quickly, so
people had to move to fresh land frequently. Among the most famous groups
of American Indians in this region was the Iroquois Confederation, a political
union of five independent tribes who lived in the Mohawk Valley of New York.
The five tribes were the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk.
Multiple families related through a mother lived in longhouses, up to 200 feet
long. From the 16th century through the American Revolution, the Iroquois
were a powerful force, battling rival American Indians as well as Europeans.

Atlantic Seaboard Settlements In the area from New Jersey south to
Florida lived the people of the Coastal Plains. Many were descendants of the
Woodland mound builders and built timber and bark lodgings along rivers. The
rivers and the Atlantic Ocean provided a rich source of food.

Europe Moves Toward Exploration

Until the late 1400s, Americans and the people of Europe, Africa, and Asia
had no knowledge of the people on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. While
Vikings from Scandinavia had visited Greenland and North America around
the year 1000, these voyages had no lasting impact. Columbus’s voyages of
exploration finally brought people into contact across the Atlantic. Several factors made an oceanic crossing and exploration possible in the late 15th century.
Improvements in Technology

In Europe, a rebirth of classical learning prompted an outburst of artistic and
scientific activity in the 15th and 16th centuries known as the Renaissance.
Several of the technological advances during the Renaissance resulted from
Europeans making improvements in the inventions of others. For example,
they began to use gunpowder (invented by the Chinese) and the sailing compass (adopted from Arab merchants who learned about it from the Chinese).
Europeans also made major improvements in shipbuilding and mapmaking. In
addition, the invention of the printing press in the 1450s aided the spread of
knowledge across Europe.

Religious Conflict

The later years of the Renaissance were a time of intense religious zeal and
conflict. The Roman Catholic Church that had once dominated Western Europe
was threatened from without by Ottoman Turks who were followers of Islam
and from within by a revolt against the pope’s authority.

Catholic Victory in Spain In the 8th century, Islamic invaders from
North Africa, known as Moors, rapidly conquered most of what is now Spain.
Over the next several centuries, Spanish Christians reconquered much of the
land and set up several independent kingdoms. Two of the largest of these kingdoms united when Isabella, queen of Castile, and Ferdinand, king of Aragon,
married in 1469. In 1492, under the leadership of Isabella and Ferdinand, the
Spanish conquered the last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the city of Granada.
In that year, the monarchs also funded Christopher Columbus on his historic
first voyage. The uniting of Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand, the conquest

of Granada, and the launching of Columbus signaled new leadership, hope, and
power for Europeans who followed the Roman Catholic faith.

Protestant Revolt in Northern Europe In the early 1500s, certain Christians in Germany, England, France, Holland, and other northern European
countries revolted against the authority of the pope in Rome. Their revolt was
known as the Protestant Reformation. Conflict between Catholics and Protestants led to a series of religious wars. The conflict also caused the Catholics of
Spain and Portugal and the Protestants of England and Holland to want to spread
their own versions of Christianity to people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas,
Thus, a religious motive for exploration and colonization was added to political
and economic motives.

Expanding Trade

Economic motives for exploration grew out of a fierce competition among European kingdoms for increased trade with Africa, India, and China. In the past,
merchants had traveled from the Italian city-state of Venice and the Byzantine
city of Constantinople on a long, slow, expensive overland route that reached all
the way to the capital of the Chinese empire. This land route to Asia had become
blocked in 1453 when the Ottoman Turks seized control of Constantinople.

New Routes So the challenge to finding a new way to the rich Asian trade
appeared to be by sailing either south along the West African coast east to
China, or sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese, who realized
the route south and east was the shortest path, thought this option seemed more
promising. Voyages of exploration sponsored by Portugal’s Prince Henry the
Navigator eventually succeeded in opening up a long sea route around South
Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. In 1498, the Portuguese sea captain Vasco da
Gama was the first European to reach India via this route. By this time, Columbus had attempted what he mistakenly believed would be a shorter route to Asia.

Slave Trading Since ancient times people in Europe, Africa, and Asia had
enslaved people captured in wars. In the 15th century, the Portuguese began
trading for slaves from West Africa. They used the slaves to work newly established sugar plantations on the Madeira and Azores islands off the African coast.
Producing sugar with slave labor was so profitable that when Europeans later
established colonies in the Americas, they used the slave system there.

African Resistance Enslaved Africans resisted slavery in whatever ways
they could. Though transported thousands of miles from their homelands and
brutally repressed, they often ran away, sabotaged work, or revolted. And for
generations they maintained aspects of their African culture, particularly in
music, religion, and folkways.

Developing Nation-States

Europe was also changing politically in the 15th century. Small kingdoms, such
as Castile and Aragon, were uniting into larger ones. Enormous multiethnic
empires, such as the sprawling Holy Roman Empire in central Europe, were
breaking up. Replacing the small kingdoms and the multiethnic empires were

nation-states, countries in which the majority of people shared both a common
culture and common loyalty toward a central government. The monarchs of the
emerging nation-states, such as Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain; Prince Henry
the Navigator of Portugal; and similar monarchs of France, England, and the
Netherlands; depended on trade to bring in needed revenues and on the church
to justify their right to rule. They used their power to search for riches abroad
and to spread the influence of their version of Christianity to new overseas
dominions.

Early Explorations

Changing economic, political, and social conditions in Europe shaped the ambitions of the Italian-born Christopher Columbus.

Christopher Columbus

Columbus spent eight years seeking financial support for his plan to sail west
from Europe to the “Indies.” Finally, in 1492, he succeeded in winning the
backing of Isabella and Ferdinand. The two Spanish monarchs were then at the
height of their power, having just defeated the Moors in Granada. They agreed
to outfit three ships and to make Columbus governor, admiral, and viceroy of all
the lands that he would claim for Spain.

After sailing from the Canary Islands on September 6, Columbus landed on
an island in the Bahamas on October 12. His success in reaching lands on the
other side of the ocean brought him a burst of glory in Spain. But three subsequent voyages across the Atlantic were disappointing—he found little gold, few
spices, and no simple path to China and India.

Columbus’s Legacy Columbus died in 1506, still believing that he had
found a western route to Asia. However, many Spaniards viewed Columbus as
a failure because they suspected that he had found not a valuable trade route,
but a “New World.” Today, some people scoff at Columbus for having erroneously giving the people he encountered the name “Indians.” Even the land that
he had explored was named for someone else, Amerigo Vespucci, another Italian sailor. Columbus’s critics also point out the many problems and injustices
suffered by the natives of the Americas after Europeans arrived and took over
their land.

Nevertheless, most historians agree on Columbus’s importance. Modern
scholars have recognized his great skills as a navigator and his daring commitment in going forth where nobody else had ever dared to venture. Furthermore,
Columbus’s voyages brought about, for the first time in history, permanent interaction between people from all over the globe. He changed the world forever.

Exchanges Europeans and the original inhabitants of the Americas had
developed vastly different cultures over the millennia. The contact between
them resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and
germs from one side of the Atlantic to the other for the first time. Europeans
learned about many new plants and foods, including beans, corn, sweet and

white potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. They also contracted a new disease,
syphilis. Europeans introduced to the Americas sugar cane, bluegrasses, pigs,
and horses, as well as the wheel, iron implements, and guns. Deadlier than al]
the guns was the European importation of germs and diseases, such as smallpox
and measles, to which the natives had no immunity. Millions died (there was
a mortality rate of more than 90 percent), including entire tribal communities,
These exchanges, biological and cultural, would permanently change the entire
world.

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  

Dividing the Americas

Spain and Portugal were the first European kingdoms to claim territories in the
Americas. Their claims overlapped, leading to disputes. The Catholic monarchs
of the two countries turned to the pope in Rome to resolve their differences. In
1493, the pope drew a vertical, north-south line on a world map, called the /ine
of demarcation. The pope granted Spain all lands to the west of the line and
Portugal all lands to the east.

In 1494, Spain and Portugal moved the pope’s line a few degrees to the
west and signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas. The line passed
through what is now the country of Brazil. This treaty, together with Portuguese
explorations, established Portugal’s claim to Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of
the Americas. However, other European countries soon challenged these claims.

  

Spanish Exploration and Conquest

Spanish dominance in the Americas was based on more than a papal ruling and
a treaty. Spain owed its expanding power to its explorers and conquerors (called
conquistadores). Feats such as the journey across the Isthmus of Panama to the
Pacific Ocean by Vasco Niifiez de Balboa, the circumnavigation of the world by
one of Ferdinand Magellan’s ships (Magellan died before completing the trip),
the conquests of the Aztecs in Mexico by Hernan Cortés, and the conquest of
the Incas in Peru by Francisco Pizzaro secured Spain’s initial supremacy in the
Americas.

The conquistadores sent ships loaded with gold and silver back to Spain
from Mexico and Peru. They increased the gold supply by more than 500 percent, making Spain the richest and most powerful nation in Europe. Spain’s
success encouraged other nations to turn to the Americas in search of gold and
power. After seizing the wealth of the Indian empires, the Spanish instituted an
encomienda system, with the king of Spain giving grants of land and natives
to individual Spaniards. These Indians had to farm or work in the mines. The
fruits of their labors went to their Spanish masters, who in turn had to “care” for
them. As Europeans’ diseases and brutality reduced the native population, the
Spanish brought enslaved people from West Africa under the asiento system.
This required the Spanish to pay a tax to their king on each slave they imported
to the Americas.

English Claims
England’s earliest claims to territory in the Americas rested on the voyages of
John Cabot, an Italian sea captain who sailed under contract to England’s King
Henry VII. Cabot explored the coast of Newfoundland in 1497.

England, however, did not follow up Cabot’s discoveries with other expeditions of exploration and settlement. Other issues preoccupied England’s
monarchy in the 1500s, including Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic
Church. In the 1570s and 1580s, under Queen Elizabeth I, England challenged
Spanish shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sir Francis Drake, for
example, attacked Spanish ships, seized the gold and silver that they carried,
and even attacked Spanish settlements on the coast of Peru. Another English
adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, attempted to establish a settlement at Roanoke
Island off the North Carolina coast in 1587, but the venture failed.

French Claims
The French monarchy first showed interest in exploration in 1524 when it spon.
sored a voyage by an Italian navigator, Giovanni da Verrazano. Hoping to fing
a northwest passage leading through the Americas to Asia, Verrazano explored
part of North America’s eastern coast, including the New York harbor. French
claims to American territory were also based on the voyages of Jacques Cartier
(1534-1542), who explored the St. Lawrence River extensively.

Like the English, the French were slow to develop colonies across the Atlantic. During the 1500s, the French monarchy was preoccupied with European
wars as well as with internal religious conflict between Roman Catholics and
French Protestants known as Huguenots. Only in the next century did France
develop a strong interest in following up its claims to North American land.

The first permanent French settlement in America was established by Samuel de Champlain in 1608 at Quebec, a fortified village on the St. Lawrence
River, Champlain’s strong leadership won him the nickname “Father of New
France.” Other explorers extended French claims across a vast territory. In
1673, Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper Mississippi River, and in 1682, Robert de La Salle explored the Mississippi basin,
which he named Louisiana (after the French king, Louis XIV).

Dutch Claims

During the 1600s, the Netherlands also began to sponsor voyages of exploration. The Dutch government hired Henry Hudson, an experienced English
sailor, to seek westward passage to Asia through northern America. In 1609,
while searching for a northwest passage, Hudson sailed up a broad river that
was later named for him, the Hudson River. This expedition established Dutch
claims to the surrounding area that would become New Amsterdam (and later
New York). The Dutch government granted a private company, the Dutch West
India Company, the right to control the region for economic gain.

Spanish Settlements in North America
Spanish settlements developed slowly in North America, as a result of limited
mineral resources and strong opposition from American Indians.

Florida After a number of failed attempts and against the strong resistance
of American Indians in the region, the Spanish established a permanent settlement at St. Augustine in 1565. Today, St. Augustine is the oldest city in North
America founded by Europeans.

New Mexico Santa Fe was established as the capital of New Mexico in
1610. Harsh efforts to Christianize the American Indians caused the Pueblo
people to revolt in 1680. The Spanish were driven from the area until 1692.

Texas In between Florida and New Mexico, the Spanish established settlements in Texas. These communities grew in the early 1700s as Spain attempted

California In response to Russian exploration from Alaska, the Spanish
established permanent settlements at San Diego in 1769 and San Francisco in
1776. By 1784, a series of missions or settlements had been established along
the California coast by members of the Franciscan order. Father Junipero Serra
founded nine of these missions.

European Treatment of Native Americans

Most Europeans looked down upon Native Americans. The Europeans who colonized North and South America generally viewed Native Americans as inferior
people who could be exploited for economic gain, converted to Christianity,
and used as military allies. However, Europeans used various approaches for
controlling Native Americans and operating their colonies.

Spanish Policy

The Spanish who settled in Mexico and Peru encountered the highly organized Aztec and Inca empires. Even after diseases killed most natives, millions
remained in these empires that the Spanish could incorporate as laborers in their
own empire. Many natives who did not die from disease died from forced labor.
Because few families came from Spain to settle the empire, the explorers and
soldiers intermarried with natives as well as with Africans. The latter were captured in Africa and forced to travel across the ocean to provide slave labor for
the Spanish colonists. A rigid class system developed in the Spanish colonies,
one dominated by pure-blooded Spaniards.

Bartolomé de Las Casas One European who dissented from the views
of most Europeans toward Native Americans was a Spanish priest named Bartolomé de Las Casas. Though he had owned land and slaves in the West Indies
and had fought in wars against the Indians, he eventually became an advocate
for better treatment for Indians. He persuaded the king to institute the New
Laws of 1542. These laws ended Indian slavery, halted forced Indian labor,
and began to end the encomienda system which kept the Indians in serfdom.
Conservative Spaniards, eager to keep the encomienda system, responded and
successfully pushed the king to repeal parts of the New Laws.

Valladolid Debate The debate over the role for Indians in the Spanish
colonies came to a head in a formal debate in 1550-1551 in Valladolid, Spain.
On one side, Las Casas argued that the Indians were completely human and
morally equal to Europeans. so enslaving them was not justified. On the other
side, another priest, Juan Ginés de Sepulveda, argued that Indians were less than
human. Hence, they benefited from serving the Spaniards in the econmienda
system. Neither side clearly won the debate. Though Las Casas was unable to
gain equal treatment for Native Americans, he established the basic arguments
on behalf of justice for Indians.

English Policy

Unlike the Spanish, the English settled in areas without large native empires
that could be controlled as a workforce. In addition, many English colonists
came in families rather than as single young men, so marriage with natives was
less common. Initially, at least in Massachusetts, the English and the American
Indians coexisted, traded, and shared ideas. American Indians taught the settlers
how to grow new crops such as corn (maize) and showed them how to hunt
in the forests. They traded various furs for an array of English manufactureq
goods, including iron tools and weapons. But peaceful relations soon gave way
to conflict and open warfare. The English had no respect for American Indian
cultures, which they viewed as primitive or “savage.” For their part, American
Indians saw their way of life threatened as the English began to take more land
to support their ever-increasing population. The English occupied the land and
forced the small, scattered tribes they encountered to move away from the coast
to inland territories. They expelled the natives rather than subjugating them,

French Policy

The French, looking for furs and converts to Catholicism, viewed American
Indians as potential economic and military allies. Compared to the Spaniards
and the English, the French maintained good relations with the tribes they
encountered. Seeking to control the fur trade, the French built trading posts
throughout the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, and along the Mississippi River. At these posts, they exchanged French goods for beaver pelts and
other furs collected by American Indians. Because the French had few colonists, farms, or towns, they posed less threat to the native population than did
other Europeans. In addition, French soldiers assisted the Huron people in fighting their traditional enemy, the Iroquois.

Native American Reaction

North American tribes saw themselves as groups distinct from each other, not
as part of a larger body of Native Americans. As a result, European settlers
rarely had to be concerned with a unified response from the Native Americans.
Initially the European goods such as copper pots and guns had motivated the
natives to interact with the strangers. After the decimation of their peoples from
the violence and disease of the Europeans, the Native Americans had to adopt
new ways to survive. Upon observing the Europeans fighting each other, some
tribes allied themselves with one European power or another in hopes of gaining support in order to survive. A number of tribes simply migrated to new land
to get away from the slowly encroaching settlers. Regardless of how they dealt
with the European invasion, Native Americans would never be able to return to
the life they had known prior to 1492.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES: WAS COLUMBUS A GREAT HERO?

Over the centuries, Columbus has received both praise for his role as a
“discoverer” and blame for his actions as a “conqueror.” In the United
States, he has traditionally been viewed as a hero. As early as 1828,
Washington Irving wrote a popular biography extolling the explorer’s
virtues. The apex of Columbus’s heroic reputation was reached in 1934
when President Franklin Roosevelt declared October 12 a national
holiday.

Since the 1990s, however, revisionist histories and biographies have
been highly critical of Columbus. His detractors argue that Columbus
was simply at the right place at the right time. Europe at the end of the
15th century was ready to expand. If Columbus had not crossed the
Atlantic in 1492, some other explorer—perhaps Vespucci or Cabot—
would have done so a few years later. According to this interpretation,
Columbus was little more than a good navigator and a self-promoter
who exploited an opportunity.

Some revisionists take a harsh view of Columbus and regard him
not as the first discoverer of America but rather as its first conqueror.
They portray him as a religious fanatic in the European Christian tradition who sought to convert the American natives to Christianity and
liquidated those who resisted.

The revisionist argument has not gone unanswered. For example,
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. has argued that the chief motivation
for Columbus’s deeds was neither greed for gold nor ambition for conquest. What drove him, in Schlesinger’s view, was the challenge of the
unknown. Columbus’s apologists admit that millions of Native Americans died as a result of European exploration in the Americas, but they
point out that an unknown number had suffered horrible deaths in Aztec
sacrifices. Moreover, the mistreatment of Native Americans was perhaps partially offset by such positive results as the gradual development
of democratic institutions in the colonies and later the United States.

Historians will continue to debate the nature of Columbus’s achievement. As with other historical questions, distinguishing between fact
and fiction and separating a writer’s personal biases from objective reality is difficult. One conclusion is inescapable: As a result of Columbus’s
voyages, world history took a sharp turn in a new direction. His explorations established a permanent point of contact between Europeans and
the first Americans, and soon between both groups and Africans. People
are still living with the consequences of this interaction.

1491-1607

Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493

Tee original discovery, exploration, and settlement of North and South America occurred at least 10,000 years before Christopher Columbus was born. Some
archeologists estimate that the first people settled in North America 40,000 years
ago. Migrants from Asia may have crossed a land bridge that once connected
Siberia and Alaska (land now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over time,
people migrated southward from near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of
South America. The first Americans adapted to the varied environments of the
regions that they found. They evolved into hundreds of tribes, spoke different
languages, and practiced different cultures. Estimates of the native population
in the Americas in the 1490s vary from 50 million to 100 million people.

Cultures of Central and South America

The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations.
Between A.D. 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the rain forests
of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico). Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central
Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, had a
population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the largest cities of
Europe. While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the
Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in South America. All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an extensive trade, and
created calendars that were based on accurate scientific observations. All three
cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply, particularly corn (maize) for
the Mayas and Aztecs and potatoes for the Incas.

2Cultures of North America

The population in the region north of Mexico (present-day United States and
Canada) in the 1490s may have been anywhere from under | million to more
than 10 million. In general, the native societies in this region were smaller and
Jess sophisticated than those in Mexico and South America. One reason for
this was how slowly the cultivation of corn (maize) spread northward from
Mexico.

Some of the most populous and complex societies in North America had
disappeared by the 15th century, for reasons not well understood. By the time
of Columbus, most people in the Americas in what is now the United States
and Canada lived in semipermanent settlements in groups seldom exceeding
300 people. The men made tools and hunted for game, while the women gathered plants and nuts or grew crops such as corn (maize), beans, and tobacco.

Language Beyond these similarities, the cultures of American Indians
were very diverse. For example, while English, Spanish, and almost all other
European languages were part of just one language family (Indo-European),
American Indian languages constituted more than 20 language families.
Among the largest of these were Algonquian in the Northeast, Siouan on the
Great Plains, and Athabaskan in the Southwest. Together, these 20 families
included more than 400 distinct languages.

Southwest Settlements In the dry region that now includes New Mexico and Arizona, groups such as the Hokokam, Anasazi, and Pueblos evolved
multifaceted societies supported by farming with irrigation systems. In large
numbers they lived in caves, under cliffs, and in multistoried buildings. By the
time Europeans arrived, extreme drought and other hostile natives had taken
their toll on these groups. However, much of their way of life was preserved in
the arid land and their stone and masonry dwellings.

Northwest Settlements Along the Pacific coast from what is today Alaska
to northern California, people lived in permanent longhouses or plank houses.
They had a rich diet based on hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts, berries, and
roots. To save stories, legends, and myths, they carved large totem poles. The
high mountain ranges in this region isolated tribes from one another, creating

barriers to development.

Great Plains Most people who liv
nomadic hunters or sedentary people wt
tribes survived on hunting, principally the buffalo, which supplied their food as
well as decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. They lived in tepees,

frames of poles covered in animal skins, which were easily disassembled and
transported. While the farming tribes also hunted buffalo, they lived permanently in earthen lodges often along rivers. They raised corn (maize), beans,
and squash while actively trading with other tribes. Not until the 17th century
did American Indians acquire horses by trading or stealing them from Spanish
settlers. With horses, tribes such as the Lakota Sioux moved away from farming to hunting and easily following the buffalo across the plains. The plains
tribes would at times merge or split apart as conditions changed. Migration
also was common. For example, the Apaches gradually migrated southward

from Canada to Texas.
Midwest Settlements East of the Mississippi River, the Woodland Amered by hunting, fishing,

ican Indians prospered with a rich food supply. Support
and agriculture, many permanent settlements developed in the Mississippi and
Ohio River valleys and elsewhere. The Adena-Hopewell culture, centered in
what is now Ohio, is famous for the large earthen mounds it created, some
as large as 300 feet long. One of the largest settlements in the Midwest was
Cahokia (near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois), with as many as 30,000
inhabitants.

Northeast Settlements Some descendants
spread from the Ohio Valley into New York. T

ed on the Great Plains were either

and farming. However, their farming techniques exhausted the soil quickly, so
people had to move to fresh land frequently. Among the most famous groups
of American Indians in this region was the Iroquois Confederation, a political
union of five independent tribes who lived in the Mohawk Valley of New York.
The five tribes were the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk.
Multiple families related through a mother lived in longhouses, up to 200 feet
long. From the 16th century through the American Revolution, the Iroquois
were a powerful force, battling rival American Indians as well as Europeans.

Atlantic Seaboard Settlements In the area from New Jersey south to
Florida lived the people of the Coastal Plains. Many were descendants of the
Woodland mound builders and built timber and bark lodgings along rivers. The
rivers and the Atlantic Ocean provided a rich source of food.

Europe Moves Toward Exploration

Until the late 1400s, Americans and the people of Europe, Africa, and Asia
had no knowledge of the people on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. While
Vikings from Scandinavia had visited Greenland and North America around
the year 1000, these voyages had no lasting impact. Columbus’s voyages of
exploration finally brought people into contact across the Atlantic. Several factors made an oceanic crossing and exploration possible in the late 15th century.
Improvements in Technology

In Europe, a rebirth of classical learning prompted an outburst of artistic and
scientific activity in the 15th and 16th centuries known as the Renaissance.
Several of the technological advances during the Renaissance resulted from
Europeans making improvements in the inventions of others. For example,
they began to use gunpowder (invented by the Chinese) and the sailing compass (adopted from Arab merchants who learned about it from the Chinese).
Europeans also made major improvements in shipbuilding and mapmaking. In
addition, the invention of the printing press in the 1450s aided the spread of
knowledge across Europe.

Religious Conflict

The later years of the Renaissance were a time of intense religious zeal and
conflict. The Roman Catholic Church that had once dominated Western Europe
was threatened from without by Ottoman Turks who were followers of Islam
and from within by a revolt against the pope’s authority.

Catholic Victory in Spain In the 8th century, Islamic invaders from
North Africa, known as Moors, rapidly conquered most of what is now Spain.
Over the next several centuries, Spanish Christians reconquered much of the
land and set up several independent kingdoms. Two of the largest of these kingdoms united when Isabella, queen of Castile, and Ferdinand, king of Aragon,
married in 1469. In 1492, under the leadership of Isabella and Ferdinand, the
Spanish conquered the last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the city of Granada.
In that year, the monarchs also funded Christopher Columbus on his historic
first voyage. The uniting of Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand, the conquest

of Granada, and the launching of Columbus signaled new leadership, hope, and
power for Europeans who followed the Roman Catholic faith.

Protestant Revolt in Northern Europe In the early 1500s, certain Christians in Germany, England, France, Holland, and other northern European
countries revolted against the authority of the pope in Rome. Their revolt was
known as the Protestant Reformation. Conflict between Catholics and Protestants led to a series of religious wars. The conflict also caused the Catholics of
Spain and Portugal and the Protestants of England and Holland to want to spread
their own versions of Christianity to people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas,
Thus, a religious motive for exploration and colonization was added to political
and economic motives.

Expanding Trade

Economic motives for exploration grew out of a fierce competition among European kingdoms for increased trade with Africa, India, and China. In the past,
merchants had traveled from the Italian city-state of Venice and the Byzantine
city of Constantinople on a long, slow, expensive overland route that reached all
the way to the capital of the Chinese empire. This land route to Asia had become
blocked in 1453 when the Ottoman Turks seized control of Constantinople.

New Routes So the challenge to finding a new way to the rich Asian trade
appeared to be by sailing either south along the West African coast east to
China, or sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese, who realized
the route south and east was the shortest path, thought this option seemed more
promising. Voyages of exploration sponsored by Portugal’s Prince Henry the
Navigator eventually succeeded in opening up a long sea route around South
Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. In 1498, the Portuguese sea captain Vasco da
Gama was the first European to reach India via this route. By this time, Columbus had attempted what he mistakenly believed would be a shorter route to Asia.

Slave Trading Since ancient times people in Europe, Africa, and Asia had
enslaved people captured in wars. In the 15th century, the Portuguese began
trading for slaves from West Africa. They used the slaves to work newly established sugar plantations on the Madeira and Azores islands off the African coast.
Producing sugar with slave labor was so profitable that when Europeans later
established colonies in the Americas, they used the slave system there.

African Resistance Enslaved Africans resisted slavery in whatever ways
they could. Though transported thousands of miles from their homelands and
brutally repressed, they often ran away, sabotaged work, or revolted. And for
generations they maintained aspects of their African culture, particularly in
music, religion, and folkways.

Developing Nation-States

Europe was also changing politically in the 15th century. Small kingdoms, such
as Castile and Aragon, were uniting into larger ones. Enormous multiethnic
empires, such as the sprawling Holy Roman Empire in central Europe, were
breaking up. Replacing the small kingdoms and the multiethnic empires were

nation-states, countries in which the majority of people shared both a common
culture and common loyalty toward a central government. The monarchs of the
emerging nation-states, such as Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain; Prince Henry
the Navigator of Portugal; and similar monarchs of France, England, and the
Netherlands; depended on trade to bring in needed revenues and on the church
to justify their right to rule. They used their power to search for riches abroad
and to spread the influence of their version of Christianity to new overseas
dominions.

Early Explorations

Changing economic, political, and social conditions in Europe shaped the ambitions of the Italian-born Christopher Columbus.

Christopher Columbus

Columbus spent eight years seeking financial support for his plan to sail west
from Europe to the “Indies.” Finally, in 1492, he succeeded in winning the
backing of Isabella and Ferdinand. The two Spanish monarchs were then at the
height of their power, having just defeated the Moors in Granada. They agreed
to outfit three ships and to make Columbus governor, admiral, and viceroy of all
the lands that he would claim for Spain.

After sailing from the Canary Islands on September 6, Columbus landed on
an island in the Bahamas on October 12. His success in reaching lands on the
other side of the ocean brought him a burst of glory in Spain. But three subsequent voyages across the Atlantic were disappointing—he found little gold, few
spices, and no simple path to China and India.

Columbus’s Legacy Columbus died in 1506, still believing that he had
found a western route to Asia. However, many Spaniards viewed Columbus as
a failure because they suspected that he had found not a valuable trade route,
but a “New World.” Today, some people scoff at Columbus for having erroneously giving the people he encountered the name “Indians.” Even the land that
he had explored was named for someone else, Amerigo Vespucci, another Italian sailor. Columbus’s critics also point out the many problems and injustices
suffered by the natives of the Americas after Europeans arrived and took over
their land.

Nevertheless, most historians agree on Columbus’s importance. Modern
scholars have recognized his great skills as a navigator and his daring commitment in going forth where nobody else had ever dared to venture. Furthermore,
Columbus’s voyages brought about, for the first time in history, permanent interaction between people from all over the globe. He changed the world forever.

Exchanges Europeans and the original inhabitants of the Americas had
developed vastly different cultures over the millennia. The contact between
them resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and
germs from one side of the Atlantic to the other for the first time. Europeans
learned about many new plants and foods, including beans, corn, sweet and

white potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. They also contracted a new disease,
syphilis. Europeans introduced to the Americas sugar cane, bluegrasses, pigs,
and horses, as well as the wheel, iron implements, and guns. Deadlier than al]
the guns was the European importation of germs and diseases, such as smallpox
and measles, to which the natives had no immunity. Millions died (there was
a mortality rate of more than 90 percent), including entire tribal communities,
These exchanges, biological and cultural, would permanently change the entire
world.

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  

Dividing the Americas

Spain and Portugal were the first European kingdoms to claim territories in the
Americas. Their claims overlapped, leading to disputes. The Catholic monarchs
of the two countries turned to the pope in Rome to resolve their differences. In
1493, the pope drew a vertical, north-south line on a world map, called the /ine
of demarcation. The pope granted Spain all lands to the west of the line and
Portugal all lands to the east.

In 1494, Spain and Portugal moved the pope’s line a few degrees to the
west and signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas. The line passed
through what is now the country of Brazil. This treaty, together with Portuguese
explorations, established Portugal’s claim to Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of
the Americas. However, other European countries soon challenged these claims.

  

Spanish Exploration and Conquest

Spanish dominance in the Americas was based on more than a papal ruling and
a treaty. Spain owed its expanding power to its explorers and conquerors (called
conquistadores). Feats such as the journey across the Isthmus of Panama to the
Pacific Ocean by Vasco Niifiez de Balboa, the circumnavigation of the world by
one of Ferdinand Magellan’s ships (Magellan died before completing the trip),
the conquests of the Aztecs in Mexico by Hernan Cortés, and the conquest of
the Incas in Peru by Francisco Pizzaro secured Spain’s initial supremacy in the
Americas.

The conquistadores sent ships loaded with gold and silver back to Spain
from Mexico and Peru. They increased the gold supply by more than 500 percent, making Spain the richest and most powerful nation in Europe. Spain’s
success encouraged other nations to turn to the Americas in search of gold and
power. After seizing the wealth of the Indian empires, the Spanish instituted an
encomienda system, with the king of Spain giving grants of land and natives
to individual Spaniards. These Indians had to farm or work in the mines. The
fruits of their labors went to their Spanish masters, who in turn had to “care” for
them. As Europeans’ diseases and brutality reduced the native population, the
Spanish brought enslaved people from West Africa under the asiento system.
This required the Spanish to pay a tax to their king on each slave they imported
to the Americas.

English Claims
England’s earliest claims to territory in the Americas rested on the voyages of
John Cabot, an Italian sea captain who sailed under contract to England’s King
Henry VII. Cabot explored the coast of Newfoundland in 1497.

England, however, did not follow up Cabot’s discoveries with other expeditions of exploration and settlement. Other issues preoccupied England’s
monarchy in the 1500s, including Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic
Church. In the 1570s and 1580s, under Queen Elizabeth I, England challenged
Spanish shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sir Francis Drake, for
example, attacked Spanish ships, seized the gold and silver that they carried,
and even attacked Spanish settlements on the coast of Peru. Another English
adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, attempted to establish a settlement at Roanoke
Island off the North Carolina coast in 1587, but the venture failed.

The French monarchy first showed interest in exploration in 1524 when it spon.
sored a voyage by an Italian navigator, Giovanni da Verrazano. Hoping to fing
a northwest passage leading through the Americas to Asia, Verrazano explored
part of North America’s eastern coast, including the New York harbor. French
claims to American territory were also based on the voyages of Jacques Cartier
(1534-1542), who explored the St. Lawrence River extensively.

Like the English, the French were slow to develop colonies across the Atlantic. During the 1500s, the French monarchy was preoccupied with European
wars as well as with internal religious conflict between Roman Catholics and
French Protestants known as Huguenots. Only in the next century did France
develop a strong interest in following up its claims to North American land.

The first permanent French settlement in America was established by Samuel de Champlain in 1608 at Quebec, a fortified village on the St. Lawrence
River, Champlain’s strong leadership won him the nickname “Father of New
France.” Other explorers extended French claims across a vast territory. In
1673, Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper Mississippi River, and in 1682, Robert de La Salle explored the Mississippi basin,
which he named Louisiana (after the French king, Louis XIV).

Dutch Claims

During the 1600s, the Netherlands also began to sponsor voyages of exploration. The Dutch government hired Henry Hudson, an experienced English
sailor, to seek westward passage to Asia through northern America. In 1609,
while searching for a northwest passage, Hudson sailed up a broad river that
was later named for him, the Hudson River. This expedition established Dutch
claims to the surrounding area that would become New Amsterdam (and later
New York). The Dutch government granted a private company, the Dutch West
India Company, the right to control the region for economic gain.

Spanish Settlements in North America
Spanish settlements developed slowly in North America, as a result of limited
mineral resources and strong opposition from American Indians.

Florida After a number of failed attempts and against the strong resistance
of American Indians in the region, the Spanish established a permanent settlement at St. Augustine in 1565. Today, St. Augustine is the oldest city in North
America founded by Europeans.

New Mexico Santa Fe was established as the capital of New Mexico in
1610. Harsh efforts to Christianize the American Indians caused the Pueblo
people to revolt in 1680. The Spanish were driven from the area until 1692.

Texas In between Florida and New Mexico, the Spanish established settlements in Texas. These communities grew in the early 1700s as Spain attempted
to resist French efforts to explore the lower Mississippi River.

California In response to Russian exploration from Alaska, the Spanish
established permanent settlements at San Diego in 1769 and San Francisco in
1776. By 1784, a series of missions or settlements had been established along
the California coast by members of the Franciscan order. Father Junipero Serra
founded nine of these missions.

European Treatment of Native Americans

Most Europeans looked down upon Native Americans. The Europeans who colonized North and South America generally viewed Native Americans as inferior
people who could be exploited for economic gain, converted to Christianity,
and used as military allies. However, Europeans used various approaches for
controlling Native Americans and operating their colonies.

Spanish Policy

The Spanish who settled in Mexico and Peru encountered the highly organized Aztec and Inca empires. Even after diseases killed most natives, millions
remained in these empires that the Spanish could incorporate as laborers in their
own empire. Many natives who did not die from disease died from forced labor.
Because few families came from Spain to settle the empire, the explorers and
soldiers intermarried with natives as well as with Africans. The latter were captured in Africa and forced to travel across the ocean to provide slave labor for
the Spanish colonists. A rigid class system developed in the Spanish colonies,
one dominated by pure-blooded Spaniards.

Bartolomé de Las Casas One European who dissented from the views
of most Europeans toward Native Americans was a Spanish priest named Bartolomé de Las Casas. Though he had owned land and slaves in the West Indies
and had fought in wars against the Indians, he eventually became an advocate
for better treatment for Indians. He persuaded the king to institute the New
Laws of 1542. These laws ended Indian slavery, halted forced Indian labor,
and began to end the encomienda system which kept the Indians in serfdom.
Conservative Spaniards, eager to keep the encomienda system, responded and
successfully pushed the king to repeal parts of the New Laws.

Valladolid Debate The debate over the role for Indians in the Spanish
colonies came to a head in a formal debate in 1550-1551 in Valladolid, Spain.
On one side, Las Casas argued that the Indians were completely human and
morally equal to Europeans. so enslaving them was not justified. On the other
side, another priest, Juan Ginés de Sepulveda, argued that Indians were less than
human. Hence, they benefited from serving the Spaniards in the econmienda
system. Neither side clearly won the debate. Though Las Casas was unable to
gain equal treatment for Native Americans, he established the basic arguments
on behalf of justice for Indians.

English Policy

Unlike the Spanish, the English settled in areas without large native empires
that could be controlled as a workforce. In addition, many English colonists
came in families rather than as single young men, so marriage with natives was
less common. Initially, at least in Massachusetts, the English and the American
Indians coexisted, traded, and shared ideas. American Indians taught the settlers
how to grow new crops such as corn (maize) and showed them how to hunt
in the forests. They traded various furs for an array of English manufactureq
goods, including iron tools and weapons. But peaceful relations soon gave way
to conflict and open warfare. The English had no respect for American Indian
cultures, which they viewed as primitive or “savage.” For their part, American
Indians saw their way of life threatened as the English began to take more land
to support their ever-increasing population. The English occupied the land and
forced the small, scattered tribes they encountered to move away from the coast
to inland territories. They expelled the natives rather than subjugating them,

French Policy

The French, looking for furs and converts to Catholicism, viewed American
Indians as potential economic and military allies. Compared to the Spaniards
and the English, the French maintained good relations with the tribes they
encountered. Seeking to control the fur trade, the French built trading posts
throughout the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, and along the Mississippi River. At these posts, they exchanged French goods for beaver pelts and
other furs collected by American Indians. Because the French had few colonists, farms, or towns, they posed less threat to the native population than did
other Europeans. In addition, French soldiers assisted the Huron people in fighting their traditional enemy, the Iroquois.

Native American Reaction

North American tribes saw themselves as groups distinct from each other, not
as part of a larger body of Native Americans. As a result, European settlers
rarely had to be concerned with a unified response from the Native Americans.
Initially the European goods such as copper pots and guns had motivated the
natives to interact with the strangers. After the decimation of their peoples from
the violence and disease of the Europeans, the Native Americans had to adopt
new ways to survive. Upon observing the Europeans fighting each other, some
tribes allied themselves with one European power or another in hopes of gaining support in order to survive. A number of tribes simply migrated to new land
to get away from the slowly encroaching settlers. Regardless of how they dealt
with the European invasion, Native Americans would never be able to return to
the life they had known prior to 1492.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES: WAS COLUMBUS A GREAT HERO?

Over the centuries, Columbus has received both praise for his role as a
“discoverer” and blame for his actions as a “conqueror.” In the United
States, he has traditionally been viewed as a hero. As early as 1828,
Washington Irving wrote a popular biography extolling the explorer’s
virtues. The apex of Columbus’s heroic reputation was reached in 1934
when President Franklin Roosevelt declared October 12 a national
holiday.

Since the 1990s, however, revisionist histories and biographies have
been highly critical of Columbus. His detractors argue that Columbus
was simply at the right place at the right time. Europe at the end of the
15th century was ready to expand. If Columbus had not crossed the
Atlantic in 1492, some other explorer—perhaps Vespucci or Cabot—
would have done so a few years later. According to this interpretation,
Columbus was little more than a good navigator and a self-promoter
who exploited an opportunity.

Some revisionists take a harsh view of Columbus and regard him
not as the first discoverer of America but rather as its first conqueror.
They portray him as a religious fanatic in the European Christian tradition who sought to convert the American natives to Christianity and
liquidated those who resisted.

The revisionist argument has not gone unanswered. For example,
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. has argued that the chief motivation
for Columbus’s deeds was neither greed for gold nor ambition for conquest. What drove him, in Schlesinger’s view, was the challenge of the
unknown. Columbus’s apologists admit that millions of Native Americans died as a result of European exploration in the Americas, but they
point out that an unknown number had suffered horrible deaths in Aztec
sacrifices. Moreover, the mistreatment of Native Americans was perhaps partially offset by such positive results as the gradual development
of democratic institutions in the colonies and later the United States.

Historians will continue to debate the nature of Columbus’s achievement. As with other historical questions, distinguishing between fact
and fiction and separating a writer’s personal biases from objective reality is difficult. One conclusion is inescapable: As a result of Columbus’s
voyages, world history took a sharp turn in a new direction. His explorations established a permanent point of contact between Europeans and
the first Americans, and soon between both groups and Africans. People
are still living with the consequences of this interaction.

Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493

Tee original discovery, exploration, and settlement of North and South America occurred at least 10,000 years before Christopher Columbus was born. Some
archeologists estimate that the first people settled in North America 40,000 years
ago. Migrants from Asia may have crossed a land bridge that once connected
Siberia and Alaska (land now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over time,
people migrated southward from near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of
South America. The first Americans adapted to the varied environments of the
regions that they found. They evolved into hundreds of tribes, spoke different
languages, and practiced different cultures. Estimates of the native population
in the Americas in the 1490s vary from 50 million to 100 million people.

Cultures of Central and South America

The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations.
Between A.D. 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the rain forests
of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico). Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central
Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, had a
population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the largest cities of
Europe. While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the
Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in South America. All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an extensive trade, and
created calendars that were based on accurate scientific observations. All three
cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply, particularly corn (maize) for
the Mayas and Aztecs and potatoes for the Incas.
